          The native Linux kernel port of the SPL filesystem. 

          The Solaris Porting Layer (SPL) is a Linux kernel module which provides 
          many of the Solaris kernel APIs. This shim layer makes it possible to
          run Solaris kernel code in the Linux kernel with relatively minimal
          modification. This can be particularly useful when you want to track
          upstream Solaris development closely and do not want the overhead of
          maintaining a large patch which converts Solaris primitives to Linux
          primitives.
