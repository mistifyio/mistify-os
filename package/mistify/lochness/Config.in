          The LochNess Mistify-OS variation. 
          
          Loch Ness is a simple virtual machine manager ("cloud controller").
          It is a proof-of-concept, straight forward implementation for testing
          various ideas. It is targeted at clusters of up to 100 physical
          machines.
