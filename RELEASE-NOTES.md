## Issues ##

Building crosstools-ng requires a case sensitive operating system. This is of particular interest to OS X developers. To avoid this problem it is necessary to setup a case-sensitive file system using the Disk Utility and mount it. A typical full build of Mistify-OS requires 5GB of disk space and it will be common to have more than one build so it's recommended that the case-sensitive file system provide at least 20GB of space. This problem will be addressed in a future release.
